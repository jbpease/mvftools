# Version History

**v.0.6.0**

*2020-12-20: Major Update* - Major update to the back-end of MVF for speed and stability.  Adds support for faster file access by creating an MVF index, fixes to the filtering modules, changes to the specification of sample and contig labels to improve usability. Major improvements to the MVFTranslate module.  Added support for tetraploid and hexaploid VCF files. Many other fixes


**v.0.5.4**

2019-07-16: Adds the CalcAllCharacterCountPerSample function, continued upgrades to the screen output to provide more realtime information.  Other small fixes to the CalcPairwiseDistances module in ambiguous character mode.


**v.0.5.3**

2019-07-14: Critial update, strongly recommend updating to this version.  Major efficiency fix in the base iteration modules.  Several key bug fixes implemented in FilterMVF, MergeMVF.  Enhanced support for ambiguous sequences and polyploids in several modules including CalcPairwiseDistance.  Restructuring of FilterMVF for cleaner syntax.


**v.0.5.2**

2019-06-29: Added MergeMVF to join several files together (still experimental, use with caution).  JoinMVF is now called ConcatenateMVF to avoid confusion.  CheckMVF changed to VerifyMVF to make it more clear.  ConvertVCF2MVF now has experimental support for tetraploid and hexaploid VCF files through the --ploidy flag.  Other small fixes to the software and manual to update issues with the VCF interpreter.

**v.0.5.1**

2018-02-01: Changes to the --sample and --outgroup arguments for some calculations into separate --sample-indices and --sample-labels arguments.  This fixes an issue where if the sample labels are numerical they are misinterpreted when specified at the command line. All sample/outgroup indices or labels should be specified as a single comma-separated list.
